# TODO app
Hi, 
This is essentially my first typescript project, since i've started learning It. I wanted to try it out on a actual project. So the idea of developing this came easily.

This Project is Just a simple TODO web app.
It runs on vite + react w/typescrit.

Everything is handled locally on the client-side.

The web app implements all 4 CRUD operations.
  
- [x] Create
- [x] Read
- [x] Update
- [x] Delete

## packages / dependencies
- Lucide-react
- - Lucide is a simple react icon library.
- LocalForage
- - LocalForage is a library that makes saving data on the clients browser easie. Via its multiple api's, it can save data on indexedDB, localStorage. Here i'm using localForage to store the user TODOs locally without the need of a backend with a rest api.

# Resume of my experience.
Overall i'm pretty happy with how things are coming together. I realized typescript wasn't so difficult has i tought it would.
However, i did decide to keep typing as simple as possible and tried not to make a overcomplicated codebase, whilst also o felt i shouldn't try to use typescript features that i don't fully understand yet.
** i know nothing about the <htmlEventHandler<HtmlButtonElement>> react wanted me to use, but i had to used it anyway but again i'm still learning so theres that.

# I really wish if someone eventually see's this, that they can hint me to something i did wrong, or maybe shed me some light on best practices. I would also likes to hear if anyone has a feature that i could try to implement.
when i finish de ```
update``` i will try to getting online either on render.com , vercel or some other place maybe like firebase or microsoft appspaces.

However if you do want to test it locally right now, since its just a react codebase you clone the repository and run the following command inside this directory ```npm i && npm run dev```
