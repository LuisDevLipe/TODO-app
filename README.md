# TODO app
This is essentially my first typescript project, since i've started leraning typescript and wanted to try ir out on a actual project.
This Project is a simple TODO web app.

it runs on vite + react w/typescrit
everything is handled locally on the client-side.

The web app implements all 4 CRUD operations.
  
- [x] Create
- [x] Read
- [x] Update
- [x] Delete

## packages / dependencies
- Lucide-react
- - Lucide is a simple icon library.
- LocalForage
- - LocalForage is used here so the web app can save the user TODO's on the client side of things. AKA web browser.
 

# Resume of my experience.
Overall i'm pretty happy with how things are coming together. I realized typescript wasn't so difficult has i tought i would.
However, i did decide to keep typing as simple as possible and tried not to make a shitty codebase, whilst my brain felt i shouldn't try to use typescript features that i don't understand yet.
** i know nothing about the <htmlEventHandler<HtmlButtonElement>> react wanted me to use, but i had to used it anyway but again i'm still learning so theres that.

# I really wish if someone eventually see's this, that they can hint me to something i did wrong, or maybe shed me some light on best practices. I would also likes to hear if anyone has a feature that i could try to implement.
when i finish de ```
update``` i will try to getting online either on render.com , vercel or some other place maybe like firebase or microsoft appspaces.

However if you do want to test it locally right now, since its just a react codebase you clone the repository and run the following command inside this directory ```npm i && npm run dev```
